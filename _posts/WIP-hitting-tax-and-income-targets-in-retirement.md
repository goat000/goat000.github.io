If you're retired, hopefully you have a plan about how much to spend each year, and which accounts
to draw from.  This post isn't about that - but I'm sure I'll get into it soon enough.  This one
is about how to handle your withdrawals over the course of a year so that your ordinary income,
capital gains, and taxes all add up to what you planned, even if you have some unexpected income or
expenses during the year.

Before going further - you can probably stop reading if you are funding your retirement entirement
with a fixed income from fixed sources, like social security and a pension.  In that case, you
won't have any withdrawals to plan out (they happen automatically) and I doubt you'll need to do
much tax planning either.  Have a nice day!

With that out of the way, let's talk about whhat happens when your checking account is getting low,
and you need to decide which investments to sell in order to replenish it.  You'll have to decide on:
* Account types (taxable account, traditional and Roth retirement accounts, HSA)
* Investment types (stocks vs bonds)
* Specific tax lots (unrealized capital gains or losses)

As you work on that decision, you'll be dealing with questions like:
* How can I preserve my target asset allocation?
* How and when should I realize capital gains?
* How deal with dividends and personal spending that don't perfectly match my plans?
* What if I end up earning money during the year?
* When should I do roth conversions?

Now let's walk through a strategy to help you:
* Hit withdrawal targets from different accounts...
* And do that even with uncertain amounts of other income coming in over the course of the year...
* In a way that will hit yours targets for taxable ordinary income and capital gains.

Let's set up a hypothetical 2024 drawdown plan, and then work through how we can stick to that
plan during the year.

# Example drawdown plan for 2024

Here's a plasible drawdown plan for a married-filing-jointly couple.

|                                                        | Amount   | Notes
| ------------------------------------------------------- ---------- ------------------
| Annual budget target                                   | $125,000 | Perhaps this couple is ["ChubbyFIRE"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/) |
| Target taxable ordinary income                         | $29,200  | Matches the [Married Filing Jointly standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/tax-changes) <br> This is the maximum possible ordinary income without incurring federal income tax |
| Target AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)                     | $70,000  | Could go as high as [$94050](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/2024-tax-brackets/) and stay within 0% long-term capital gains rate, but this lower amount preserves more ACA subsidies |
| Expected qualified dividends from taxable accounts     | $25,000  | Contributes to AGI but not ordinary income |  
| Expected nonqualified dividends from taxable accounts  | $2,500   | Contributes to AGI *and* ordinary income |
| Social security, pension, or annuity income            | $0       | Let's assume they're not old enough to draw social security yet. | 

From those targets and known quantities, we can calculate:

|                                                        | Amount   | Calculation
| ------------------------------------------------------- ---------- ------------------
| Target Roth conversion | $26,700 | Standard deduction minus nonqualified dividends <br> $29,200 - $2500 <br> This sets up future years for lower taxation
| Target realized long-term capital gains, beyond expected dividends | $15,800 | Target AGI minus Roth conversion minus all dividends <br> $70,000 - $26,700 - $25,000 - $2,500
| Target taxable basis sold | $81,700 | Annual budget minus all dividends and all realized LTCG <br> $125,000 - $25,000 - $2,500 - $ 15,800

Because of our age and drawdown strategy, we're only drawing from three buckets next year: taxable basis, taxable LTCG, and traditional retirement accounts (solely to convert to Roth). If you'd like to make this example more concrete, you can scroll to the bottom for some fictional-but-reasonably-realistic numbers for a married ChubbyFIRE couple under age 59.5.

For tax efficiency purposes, all taxable accounts contain U.S. stock, whereas tax-advantaged ones contain all of our bonds and international stock. For simplicity, assume all investments are ETFs, and also let's ignore state income taxes.

Asset allocation

As I sell U.S. stock in our taxable accounts, we drift away from our intended allocation. This can be corrected by selling bonds and international stock in our retirement accounts in order to buy U.S. stock in those accounts. I plan to do this every 3 or 6 months.

Realizing capital gains

I will sell stock to fund a month or two spending at a time. Given the last couple of years, we have plenty of shares of stock that have lost value or are flat. By picking the SpecID sale option in Vanguard, I can decide exactly how much to realize when I make those sales. Because of the uncertain nature of dividends, I will mostly sell (approximately) unappreciated stock through the first ten or eleven months of the year. Near the end of the year, I will sell appreciated stock to match the target capital gains amount. If I can't find appreciated-enough stock to hit the target LTCG number, I can easily tax gain harvest. There are no wash sale rules on that, so I can just sell appreciated stock and immediately re-purchase until I get to my target.

Note that, with Vanguard, I had to wait a day or two after the first time I requested a SpecID trade before they actually populated the information necessary to sell specific lots.

Dealing with dividend and spending uncertainty

I will also hold off on doing our Traditional->Roth conversion until December, when I will have a clearer picture of our dividend income and spending. It's also possible that either my spouse or I will earn income next year - we're more like SeeIfWeFeelLikeWorkingFIRE - so we can account for that in December as well. Doing this conversion late in the year has no impact on our tax picture.

Through 2025, there are no awful income threshold traps lurking in the shadows. Prior to 2021, one could lose thousands in ACA [Obamacare] subsidies by going over the income limit by a dollar. For now, for every dollar we overshoot on AGI, we'll lose about 16 cents in Obamacare subsidies. If the overshoot is on ordinary taxable income, it'll cost 10 cents of federal tax, as well.
