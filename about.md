## Purpose
I intend to use this site to share strategies for early retirement.  I have figured out a few
things over the years, and I'd like to help others figure those things out, too.  I expect almost
all of the information on this site will be available elsewhere, but I hope to make that
information easier to use within your own financial planning.  My initial focus will be on the
retirement phase, but I may get around to some posts on the accumulation phase as well.

## About me
Ever since I started working, I wanted to stop working.  In 2023, my spouse and I hit our
financial goal for retirement.  We quit our Big Tech jobs to pursue hobbies and the occasional
passion project.
